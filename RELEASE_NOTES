    Added RELEASE_SITE to .gitignore
    Removed configure/*.local from .gitignore to keep our beloved RELEASE.local file
    BUILD_IOCS switched to YES at CONFIG_SITE
    Filtering the CROSS_COMPILER_TARGETS to only linuxRT x86_64 and host.
    First approach to a single CONFIG_SITE file for PCDS and EBEAM in terms of external packages location.
    IOC “example” building only for host as it needs X11 libraries.

    Changes to source-code:
        - FFmpeg renamed PixelFormat to AVPixelFormat
        - FFmpeg renamed PIX_FMT_* to AV_PIX_FMT_*
        - AVPixelFormat was moved to libavutil/pixfmt.h
        - avcodec_alloc_frame was deprecated. Using av_frame_alloc instead as recommended by documentation
        - Adding asynPortDriver.h for getIntegerParam
        - ADSimDetector now is separated from ADCore, applying the needed fixes at iocs for template files.
        - Adding libraries needed for STATIC BUILD (swresample, lzma)
